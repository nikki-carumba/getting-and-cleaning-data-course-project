This file is divided into 5 sections: Data, Variables, Identifiers, Measurements, Transformation
## Data 

The `tidy_data.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated values. The first row contains the names of the variables and the following rows contain the values of these variables. 

## Variables

Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

### Identifiers 

- `subject`

	Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

- `activity`

	Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values: 
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying

### Measurements 

All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration measurements, measurements with `Accelerometer` after transformation, were made in *g*'s (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope measurements (variables containing `Gyroscope`) were made in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

Magnitudes of three-dimensional signals,  measurements with containing `Magnitude` after transformation, were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

The measurements are classified in two domains:

- Time-domain signals ,`timeDomain`, resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

- Frequency-domain signals ,`frequencyDomain`, resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.

## Transformations

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

1. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
1. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each measurement. These measurements has `-mean` and `-std` in the labels. Other measurements were discarded.
1. The activity identifiers that has integer values were replaced with their corresponding descriptive activity names.
1. The measuremeny names were replaced with descriptive names:
	- Special characters such as `(`, `)`, and `-` were removed
	- The initial `f` and `t` were expanded to `frequencyDomain` and `timeDomain` respectively.
	- `Acc`, `Gyro`, `Mag`, `Freq`, `mean`, and `std` were also expanded and replaced by `Accelerometer`, `Gyroscope`, `Magnitude`, `Frequency`, `Mean`, and `StandardDeviation` respectively.
  
1. The final data set was created by getting the mean of each measurement for each activity and each subject.
